GimmerTokenSale.sol - Manages PreSale and Crowd Sale transactions - https://github.com/GimmerBot/gmr-token/blob/master/contracts/GimmerTokenSale.sol  
GimmerTokenSale.js - Automated tests for both the Token Sale and GMR Token contracts. - https://github.com/GimmerBot/gmr-token/blob/master/test/GimmerTokenSale.js

Found bugs will be rewarded proportionately to their severity.
